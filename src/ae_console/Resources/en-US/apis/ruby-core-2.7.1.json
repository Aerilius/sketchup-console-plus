{"Array":{"description":"Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.\n\nArray indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java.  A negative index is assumed\nto be relative to the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates\nthe last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the\narray, and so on.\n\n== Creating Arrays\n\nA new array can be created by using the literal constructor\n<code>[]</code>.  Arrays can contain different types of objects.  For\nexample, the array below contains an Integer, a String and a Float:\n\n   ary = [1, \"two\", 3.0] #=> [1, \"two\", 3.0]\n\nAn array can also be created by explicitly calling Array.new with zero, one\n(the initial size of the Array) or two arguments (the initial size and a\ndefault object).\n\n   ary = Array.new    #=> []\n   Array.new(3)       #=> [nil, nil, nil]\n   Array.new(3, true) #=> [true, true, true]\n\nNote that the second argument populates the array with references to the\nsame object.  Therefore, it is only recommended in cases when you need to\ninstantiate arrays with natively immutable objects such as Symbols,\nnumbers, true or false.\n\nTo create an array with separate objects a block can be passed instead.\nThis method is safe to use with mutable objects such as hashes, strings or\nother arrays:\n\n   Array.new(4) {Hash.new}    #=> [{}, {}, {}, {}]\n   Array.new(4) {|i| i.to_s } #=> [\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\n\nThis is also a quick way to build up multi-dimensional arrays:\n\n   empty_table = Array.new(3) {Array.new(3)}\n   #=> [[nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil]]\n\nAn array can also be created by using the Array() method, provided by\nKernel, which tries to call #to_ary, then #to_a on its argument.\n\nArray({:a => \"a\", :b => \"b\"}) #=> [[:a, \"a\"], [:b, \"b\"]]\n\n== Example Usage\n\nIn addition to the methods it mixes in through the Enumerable module, the\nArray class has proprietary methods for accessing, searching and otherwise\nmanipulating arrays.\n\nSome of the more common ones are illustrated below.\n\n== Accessing Elements\n\nElements in an array can be retrieved using the Array#[] method.  It can\ntake a single integer argument (a numeric index), a pair of arguments\n(start and length) or a range. Negative indices start counting from the end,\nwith -1 being the last element.\n\n   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n   arr[2]    #=> 3\n   arr[100]  #=> nil\n   arr[-3]   #=> 4\n   arr[2, 3] #=> [3, 4, 5]\n   arr[1..4] #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]\n   arr[1..-3] #=> [2, 3, 4]\n\nAnother way to access a particular array element is by using the #at method\n\n   arr.at(0) #=> 1\n\nThe #slice method works in an identical manner to Array#[].\n\nTo raise an error for indices outside of the array bounds or else to\nprovide a default value when that happens, you can use #fetch.\n\n   arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n   arr.fetch(100) #=> IndexError: index 100 outside of array bounds: -6...6\n   arr.fetch(100, \"oops\") #=> \"oops\"\n\nThe special methods #first and #last will return the first and last\nelements of an array, respectively.\n\n   arr.first #=> 1\n   arr.last  #=> 6\n\nTo return the first +n+ elements of an array, use #take\n\n   arr.take(3) #=> [1, 2, 3]\n\n#drop does the opposite of #take, by returning the elements after +n+\nelements have been dropped:\n\n   arr.drop(3) #=> [4, 5, 6]\n\n== Obtaining Information about an Array\n\nArrays keep track of their own length at all times.  To query an array\nabout the number of elements it contains, use #length, #count or #size.\n\n  browsers = ['Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Safari', 'Opera', 'IE']\n  browsers.length #=> 5\n  browsers.count #=> 5\n\nTo check whether an array contains any elements at all\n\n  browsers.empty? #=> false\n\nTo check whether a particular item is included in the array\n\n  browsers.include?('Konqueror') #=> false\n\n== Adding Items to Arrays\n\nItems can be added to the end of an array by using either #push or #<<\n\n  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n  arr.push(5) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n  arr << 6    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n#unshift will add a new item to the beginning of an array.\n\n   arr.unshift(0) #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nWith #insert you can add a new element to an array at any position.\n\n   arr.insert(3, 'apple')  #=> [0, 1, 2, 'apple', 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nUsing the #insert method, you can also insert multiple values at once:\n\n   arr.insert(3, 'orange', 'pear', 'grapefruit')\n   #=> [0, 1, 2, \"orange\", \"pear\", \"grapefruit\", \"apple\", 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n== Removing Items from an Array\n\nThe method #pop removes the last element in an array and returns it:\n\n   arr =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n   arr.pop #=> 6\n   arr #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nTo retrieve and at the same time remove the first item, use #shift:\n\n   arr.shift #=> 1\n   arr #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nTo delete an element at a particular index:\n\n   arr.delete_at(2) #=> 4\n   arr #=> [2, 3, 5]\n\nTo delete a particular element anywhere in an array, use #delete:\n\n   arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]\n   arr.delete(2) #=> 2\n   arr #=> [1,3]\n\nA useful method if you need to remove +nil+ values from an array is\n#compact:\n\n   arr = ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]\n   arr.compact  #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']\n   arr          #=> ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]\n   arr.compact! #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']\n   arr          #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']\n\nAnother common need is to remove duplicate elements from an array.\n\nIt has the non-destructive #uniq, and destructive method #uniq!\n\n   arr = [2, 5, 6, 556, 6, 6, 8, 9, 0, 123, 556]\n   arr.uniq #=> [2, 5, 6, 556, 8, 9, 0, 123]\n\n== Iterating over Arrays\n\nLike all classes that include the Enumerable module, Array has an each\nmethod, which defines what elements should be iterated over and how.  In\ncase of Array's #each, all elements in the Array instance are yielded to\nthe supplied block in sequence.\n\nNote that this operation leaves the array unchanged.\n\n   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n   arr.each {|a| print a -= 10, \" \"}\n   # prints: -9 -8 -7 -6 -5\n   #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother sometimes useful iterator is #reverse_each which will iterate over\nthe elements in the array in reverse order.\n\n   words = %w[first second third fourth fifth sixth]\n   str = \"\"\n   words.reverse_each {|word| str += \"#{word} \"}\n   p str #=> \"sixth fifth fourth third second first \"\n\nThe #map method can be used to create a new array based on the original\narray, but with the values modified by the supplied block:\n\n   arr.map {|a| 2*a}     #=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n   arr                   #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n   arr.map! {|a| a**2}   #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n   arr                   #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n== Selecting Items from an Array\n\nElements can be selected from an array according to criteria defined in a\nblock.  The selection can happen in a destructive or a non-destructive\nmanner.  While the destructive operations will modify the array they were\ncalled on, the non-destructive methods usually return a new array with the\nselected elements, but leave the original array unchanged.\n\n=== Non-destructive Selection\n\n   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n   arr.select {|a| a > 3}       #=> [4, 5, 6]\n   arr.reject {|a| a < 3}       #=> [3, 4, 5, 6]\n   arr.drop_while {|a| a < 4}   #=> [4, 5, 6]\n   arr                          #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n=== Destructive Selection\n\n#select! and #reject! are the corresponding destructive methods to #select\nand #reject\n\nSimilar to #select vs. #reject, #delete_if and #keep_if have the exact\nopposite result when supplied with the same block:\n\n   arr.delete_if {|a| a < 4}   #=> [4, 5, 6]\n   arr                         #=> [4, 5, 6]\n\n   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n   arr.keep_if {|a| a < 4}   #=> [1, 2, 3]\n   arr                       #=> [1, 2, 3]","name":"Array","namespace":"","path":"Array","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"Array#&":{"description":"Set Intersection --- Returns a new array containing unique elements common to the\ntwo arrays.

This \"peek\" only happens for IO objects.  It does not\nhappen for IO-like objects such as OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.\n\nThe best way to use IO.select is invoking it after nonblocking\nmethods such as #read_nonblock, #write_nonblock, etc.  The methods\nraise an exception which is extended by IO::WaitReadable or\nIO::WaitWritable.  The modules notify how the caller should wait\nwith IO.select.  If IO::WaitReadable is raised, the caller should\nwait for reading.  If IO::WaitWritable is raised, the caller should\nwait for writing.\n\nSo, blocking read (#readpartial) can be emulated using\n#read_nonblock and IO.select as follows:\n\n  begin\n    result = io_like.read_nonblock(maxlen)\n  rescue IO::WaitReadable\n    IO.select([io_like])\n    retry\n  rescue IO::WaitWritable\n    IO.select(nil, [io_like])\n    retry\n  end\n\nEspecially, the combination of nonblocking methods and IO.select is\npreferred for IO like objects such as OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.  It\nhas #to_io method to return underlying IO object.  IO.select calls\n#to_io to obtain the file descriptor to wait.\n\nThis means that readability notified by IO.select doesn't mean\nreadability from OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket object.\n\nThe most likely situation is that OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket buffers\nsome data.  IO.select doesn't see the buffer.  So IO.select can\nblock when OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial doesn't block.\n\nHowever, several more complicated situations exist.\n\nSSL is a protocol which is sequence of records.\nThe record consists of multiple bytes.\nSo, the remote side of SSL sends a partial record, IO.select\nnotifies readability but OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket cannot decrypt a\nbyte and OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial will block.\n\nAlso, the remote side can request SSL renegotiation which forces\nthe local SSL engine to write some data.\nThis means OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial may invoke #write\nsystem call and it can block.\nIn such a situation, OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#read_nonblock raises\nIO::WaitWritable instead of blocking.\nSo, the caller should wait for ready for writability as above\nexample.\n\nThe combination of nonblocking methods and IO.select is also useful\nfor streams such as tty, pipe socket socket when multiple processes\nread from a stream.\n\nFinally, Linux kernel developers don't guarantee that\nreadability of select(2) means readability of following read(2) even\nfor a single process.\nSee select(2) manual on GNU/Linux system.\n\nInvoking IO.select before IO#readpartial works well as usual.\nHowever it is not the best way to use IO.select.\n\nThe writability notified by select(2) doesn't show\nhow many bytes are writable.\nIO#write method blocks until given whole string is written.\nSo, <code>IO#write(two or more bytes)</code> can block after\nwritability is notified by IO.select.  IO#write_nonblock is required\nto avoid the blocking.\n\nBlocking write (#write) can be emulated using #write_nonblock and\nIO.select as follows: IO::WaitReadable should also be rescued for\nSSL renegotiation in OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.\n\n  while 0 < string.bytesize\n    begin\n      written = io_like.write_nonblock(string)\n    rescue IO::WaitReadable\n      IO.select([io_like])\n      retry\n    rescue IO::WaitWritable\n      IO.select(nil, [io_like])\n      retry\n    end\n    string = string.byteslice(written..-1)\n  end\n\n=== Parameters\nread_array:: an array of IO objects that wait until ready for read\nwrite_array:: an array of IO objects that wait until ready for write\nerror_array:: an array of IO objects that wait for exceptions\ntimeout:: a numeric value in second\n\n=== Example\n\n    rp, wp = IO.pipe\n    mesg = \"ping \"\n    100.times {\n      # IO.select follows IO#read.

This flag is necessary for\n<code>Process.kill(:SIGINT, pid)</code> on the subprocess.\n:new_pgroup is false by default.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :new_pgroup=>true)  # new process group\n  pid = spawn(command, :new_pgroup=>false) # same process group\n\nThe <code>:rlimit_</code><em>foo</em> key specifies a resource limit.\n<em>foo</em> should be one of resource types such as <code>core</code>.\nThe corresponding value should be an integer or an array which have one or\ntwo integers: same as cur_limit and max_limit arguments for\nProcess.setrlimit.\n\n  cur, max = Process.getrlimit(:CORE)\n  pid = spawn(command, :rlimit_core=>[0,max]) # disable core temporary.\n  pid = spawn(command, :rlimit_core=>max) # enable core dump\n  pid = spawn(command, :rlimit_core=>0) # never dump core.\n\nThe <code>:umask</code> key in +options+ specifies the umask.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :umask=>077)\n\nThe :in, :out, :err, an integer, an IO and an array key specifies a redirection.\nThe redirection maps a file descriptor in the child process.\n\nFor example, stderr can be merged into stdout as follows:\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :err=>:out)\n  pid = spawn(command, 2=>1)\n  pid = spawn(command, STDERR=>:out)\n  pid = spawn(command, STDERR=>STDOUT)\n\nThe hash keys specifies a file descriptor in the child process\nstarted by #spawn.\n:err, 2 and STDERR specifies the standard error stream (stderr).\n\nThe hash values specifies a file descriptor in the parent process\nwhich invokes #spawn.\n:out, 1 and STDOUT specifies the standard output stream (stdout).\n\nIn the above example,\nthe standard output in the child process is not specified.\nSo it is inherited from the parent process.\n\nThe standard input stream (stdin) can be specified by :in, 0 and STDIN.\n\nA filename can be specified as a hash value.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :in=>\"/dev/null\") # read mode\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>\"/dev/null\") # write mode\n  pid = spawn(command, :err=>\"log\") # write mode\n  pid = spawn(command, [:out, :err]=>\"/dev/null\") # write mode\n  pid = spawn(command, 3=>\"/dev/null\") # read mode\n\nFor stdout and stderr (and combination of them),\nit is opened in write mode.\nOtherwise read mode is used.\n\nFor specifying flags and permission of file creation explicitly,\nan array is used instead.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :in=>[\"file\"]) # read mode is assumed\n  pid = spawn(command, :in=>[\"file\", \"r\"])\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", \"w\"]) # 0644 assumed\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", \"w\", 0600])\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", File::WRONLY|File::EXCL|File::CREAT, 0600])\n\nThe array specifies a filename, flags and permission.\nThe flags can be a string or an integer.\nIf the flags is omitted or nil, File::RDONLY is assumed.\nThe permission should be an integer.\nIf the permission is omitted or nil, 0644 is assumed.\n\nIf an array of IOs and integers are specified as a hash key,\nall the elements are redirected.\n\n  # stdout and stderr is redirected to log file.\n  # The file \"log\" is opened just once.\n  pid = spawn(command, [:out, :err]=>[\"log\", \"w\"])\n\nAnother way to merge multiple file descriptors is [:child, fd].\n\\[:child, fd] means the file descriptor in the child process.\nThis is different from fd.\nFor example, :err=>:out means redirecting child stderr to parent stdout.\nBut :err=>[:child, :out] means redirecting child stderr to child stdout.\nThey differ if stdout is redirected in the child process as follows.\n\n  # stdout and stderr is redirected to log file.\n  # The file \"log\" is opened just once.\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", \"w\"], :err=>[:child, :out])\n\n\\[:child, :out] can be used to merge stderr into stdout in IO.popen.\nIn this case, IO.popen redirects stdout to a pipe in the child process\nand [:child, :out] refers the redirected stdout.\n\n  io = IO.popen([\"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo out; echo err >&2\", :err=>[:child, :out]])\n  p io.read #=> \"out\\nerr\\n\"\n\nThe <code>:chdir</code> key in +options+ specifies the current directory.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :chdir=>\"/var/tmp\")\n\nspawn closes all non-standard unspecified descriptors by default.\nThe \"standard\" descriptors are 0, 1 and 2.\nThis behavior is specified by :close_others option.\n:close_others doesn't affect the standard descriptors which are\nclosed only if :close is specified explicitly.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :close_others=>true)  # close 3,4,5,... (default)\n  pid = spawn(command, :close_others=>false) # don't close 3,4,5,...\n\n:close_others is false by default for spawn and IO.popen.\n\nNote that fds which close-on-exec flag is already set are closed\nregardless of :close_others option.\n\nSo IO.pipe and spawn can be used as IO.popen.\n\n  # similar to r = IO.popen(command)\n  r, w = IO.pipe\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>w)   # r, w is closed in the child process.\n  w.close\n\n:close is specified as a hash value to close a fd individually.\n\n  f = open(foo)\n  system(command, f=>:close)        # don't inherit f.\n\nIf a file descriptor need to be inherited,\nio=>io can be used.\n\n  # valgrind has --log-fd option for log destination.\n  # log_w=>log_w indicates log_w.fileno inherits to child process.\n  log_r, log_w = IO.pipe\n  pid = spawn(\"valgrind\", \"--log-fd=#{log_w.fileno}\", \"echo\", \"a\", log_w=>log_w)\n  log_w.close\n  p log_r.read\n\nIt is also possible to exchange file descriptors.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>:err, :err=>:out)\n\nThe hash keys specify file descriptors in the child process.\nThe hash values specifies file descriptors in the parent process.\nSo the above specifies exchanging stdout and stderr.\nInternally, +spawn+ uses an extra file descriptor to resolve such cyclic\nfile descriptor mapping.\n\nSee Kernel.exec for the standard shell.","name":"spawn","namespace":"Kernel","path":"Kernel#spawn","type":"module_function","visibility":"public"},"Kernel#sprintf":{"description":"Returns the string resulting from applying <i>format_string</i> to\nany additional arguments.

It is\nbad to use in contemporary programs for several reasons:\n\n* Behaviour of C's <code>crypt(3)</code> depends on the OS it is\n  run.  The generated string lacks data portability.\n\n* On some OSes such as Mac OS, <code>crypt(3)</code> never fails\n  (i.e. silently ends up in unexpected results).\n\n* On some OSes such as Mac OS, <code>crypt(3)</code> is not\n  thread safe.\n\n* So-called \"traditional\" usage of <code>crypt(3)</code> is very\n  very very weak.  According to its manpage, Linux's traditional\n  <code>crypt(3)</code> output has only 2**56 variations; too\n  easy to brute force today.  And this is the default behaviour.\n\n* In order to make things robust some OSes implement so-called\n  \"modular\" usage. To go through, you have to do a complex\n  build-up of the <code>salt_str</code> parameter, by hand.\n  Failure in generation of a proper salt string tends not to\n  yield any errors; typos in parameters are normally not\n  detectable.\n\n  * For instance, in the following example, the second invocation\n    of String#crypt is wrong; it has a typo in \"round=\" (lacks\n    \"s\").  However the call does not fail and something unexpected\n    is generated.\n\n       \"foo\".crypt(\"$5$rounds=1000$salt$\") # OK, proper usage\n       \"foo\".crypt(\"$5$round=1000$salt$\")  # Typo not detected\n\n* Even in the \"modular\" mode, some hash functions are considered\n  archaic and no longer recommended at all; for instance module\n  <code>$1$</code> is officially abandoned by its author: see\n  http://phk.freebsd.dk/sagas/md5crypt_eol.html .  For another\n  instance module <code>$3$</code> is considered completely\n  broken: see the manpage of FreeBSD.\n\n* On some OS such as Mac OS, there is no modular mode. Yet, as\n  written above, <code>crypt(3)</code> on Mac OS never fails.\n  This means even if you build up a proper salt string it\n  generates a traditional DES hash anyways, and there is no way\n  for you to be aware of.\n\n      \"foo\".crypt(\"$5$rounds=1000$salt$\") # => \"$5fNPQMxC5j6.\"\n\nIf for some reason you cannot migrate to other secure contemporary\npassword hashing algorithms, install the string-crypt gem and\n<code>require 'string/crypt'</code> to continue using it.","name":"crypt","namespace":"String","path":"String#crypt","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"String#delete":{"description":"Returns a copy of <i>str</i> with all characters in the intersection of its\narguments deleted.

Continuations are somewhat analogous to a structured\nversion of C's <code>setjmp/longjmp</code> (although they contain\nmore state, so you might consider them closer to threads).\n\nFor instance:\n\n   require \"continuation\"\n   arr = [ \"Freddie\", \"Herbie\", \"Ron\", \"Max\", \"Ringo\" ]\n   callcc{|cc| $cc = cc}\n   puts(message = arr.shift)\n   $cc.call unless message =~ /Max/\n\n<em>produces:</em>\n\n   Freddie\n   Herbie\n   Ron\n   Max\n\nAlso you can call callcc in other methods:\n\n   require \"continuation\"\n\n   def g\n     arr = [ \"Freddie\", \"Herbie\", \"Ron\", \"Max\", \"Ringo\" ]\n     cc = callcc { |cc| cc }\n     puts arr.shift\n     return cc, arr.size\n   end\n\n   def f\n     c, size = g\n     c.call(c) if size > 1\n   end\n\n   f\n\nThis (somewhat contrived) example allows the inner loop to abandon\nprocessing early:\n\n   require \"continuation\"\n   callcc {|cont|\n     for i in 0..4\n       print \"#{i}: \"\n       for j in i*5...(i+1)*5\n         cont.call() if j == 17\n         printf \"%3d\", j\n       end\n     end\n   }\n   puts\n\n<em>produces:</em>\n\n   0:   0  1  2  3  4\n   1:   5  6  7  8  9\n   2:  10 11 12 13 14\n   3:  15 16","name":"Continuation","namespace":"","path":"Continuation","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"Continuation#[]":{"description":"Invokes the continuation.

Basically they are a means of creating code blocks\nthat can be paused and resumed, much like threads. The main difference\nis that they are never preempted and that the scheduling must be done by\nthe programmer and not the VM.\n\nAs opposed to other stackless light weight concurrency models, each fiber\ncomes with a stack.  This enables the fiber to be paused from deeply\nnested function calls within the fiber block.  See the ruby(1)\nmanpage to configure the size of the fiber stack(s).\n\nWhen a fiber is created it will not run automatically. Rather it must\nbe explicitly asked to run using the Fiber#resume method.\nThe code running inside the fiber can give up control by calling\nFiber.yield in which case it yields control back to caller (the\ncaller of the Fiber#resume).\n\nUpon yielding or termination the Fiber returns the value of the last\nexecuted expression\n\nFor instance:\n\n  fiber = Fiber.new do\n    Fiber.yield 1\n    2\n  end\n\n  puts fiber.resume\n  puts fiber.resume\n  puts fiber.resume\n\n<em>produces</em>\n\n  1\n  2\n  FiberError: dead fiber called\n\nThe Fiber#resume method accepts an arbitrary number of parameters,\nif it is the first call to #resume then they will be passed as\nblock arguments. Otherwise they will be the return value of the\ncall to Fiber.yield\n\nExample:\n\n  fiber = Fiber.new do |first|\n    second = Fiber.yield first + 2\n  end\n\n  puts fiber.resume 10\n  puts fiber.resume 1_000_000\n  puts fiber.resume \"The fiber will be dead before I can cause trouble\"\n\n<em>produces</em>\n\n  12\n  1000000\n  FiberError: dead fiber called","name":"Fiber","namespace":"","path":"Fiber","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"Fiber#alive?":{"description":"Returns true if the fiber can still be resumed (or transferred\nto).

File includes\nthe methods of module FileTest as class methods, allowing you to\nwrite (for example) <code>File.exist?(\"foo\")</code>.\n\nIn the description of File methods,\n<em>permission bits</em> are a platform-specific\nset of bits that indicate permissions of a file. On Unix-based\nsystems, permissions are viewed as a set of three octets, for the\nowner, the group, and the rest of the world. For each of these\nentities, permissions may be set to read, write, or execute the\nfile:\n\nThe permission bits <code>0644</code> (in octal) would thus be\ninterpreted as read/write for owner, and read-only for group and\nother. Higher-order bits may also be used to indicate the type of\nfile (plain, directory, pipe, socket, and so on) and various other\nspecial features. If the permissions are for a directory, the\nmeaning of the execute bit changes; when set the directory can be\nsearched.\n\nOn non-Posix operating systems, there may be only the ability to\nmake a file read-only or read-write. In this case, the remaining\npermission bits will be synthesized to resemble typical values. For\ninstance, on Windows NT the default permission bits are\n<code>0644</code>, which means read/write for owner, read-only for\nall others. The only change that can be made is to make the file\nread-only, which is reported as <code>0444</code>.\n\nVarious constants for the methods in File can be found in File::Constants.","name":"File","namespace":"","path":"File","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"File#atime":{"description":"Returns the last access time (a Time object) for <i>file</i>, or\nepoch if <i>file</i> has not been accessed.\n\n   File.new(\"testfile\").atime   #=> Wed Dec 31 18:00:00 CST 1969","name":"atime","namespace":"File","path":"File#atime","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"File#birthtime":{"description":"Returns the birth time for <i>file</i>.\n\n   File.new(\"testfile\").birthtime   #=> Wed Apr 09 08:53:14 CDT 2003\n\nIf the platform doesn't have birthtime, raises NotImplementedError.","name":"birthtime","namespace":"File","path":"File#birthtime","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"File#chmod":{"description":"Changes permission bits on <i>file</i> to the bit pattern\nrepresented by <i>mode_int</i>.

But as the name insists, its\ncharacters in the range of ASCII are considered as ASCII\ncharacters.  This is useful when you use ASCII-8BIT characters with\nother ASCII compatible characters.\n\n== Changing an encoding\n\nThe associated Encoding of a String can be changed in two different ways.\n\nFirst, it is possible to set the Encoding of a string to a new Encoding\nwithout changing the internal byte representation of the string, with\nString#force_encoding. This is how you can tell Ruby the correct encoding\nof a string.\n\n  string\n  #=> \"R\\xC3\\xA9sum\\xC3\\xA9\"\n  string.encoding\n  #=> #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>\n  string.force_encoding(Encoding::UTF_8)\n  #=> \"R\\u00E9sum\\u00E9\"\n\nSecond, it is possible to transcode a string, i.e. translate its internal\nbyte representation to another encoding. Its associated encoding is also\nset to the other encoding. See String#encode for the various forms of\ntranscoding, and the Encoding::Converter class for additional control over\nthe transcoding process.\n\n  string\n  #=> \"R\\u00E9sum\\u00E9\"\n  string.encoding\n  #=> #<Encoding:UTF-8>\n  string = string.encode!(Encoding::ISO_8859_1)\n  #=> \"R\\xE9sum\\xE9\"\n  string.encoding\n  #=> #<Encoding::ISO-8859-1>\n\n== Script encoding\n\nAll Ruby script code has an associated Encoding which any String literal\ncreated in the source code will be associated to.\n\nThe default script encoding is Encoding::UTF_8 after v2.0, but it\ncan be changed by a magic comment on the first line of the source\ncode file (or second line, if there is a shebang line on the\nfirst). The comment must contain the word <code>coding</code> or\n<code>encoding</code>, followed by a colon, space and the Encoding\nname or alias:\n\n  # encoding: UTF-8\n\n  \"some string\".encoding\n  #=> #<Encoding:UTF-8>\n\nThe <code>__ENCODING__</code> keyword returns the script encoding of the file\nwhich the keyword is written:\n\n  # encoding: ISO-8859-1\n\n  __ENCODING__\n  #=> #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>\n\n<code>ruby -K</code> will change the default locale encoding, but this is\nnot recommended. Ruby source files should declare its script encoding by a\nmagic comment even when they only depend on US-ASCII strings or regular\nexpressions.\n\n== Locale encoding\n\nThe default encoding of the environment. Usually derived from locale.\n\nsee Encoding.locale_charmap, Encoding.find('locale')\n\n== Filesystem encoding\n\nThe default encoding of strings from the filesystem of the environment.\nThis is used for strings of file names or paths.\n\nsee Encoding.find('filesystem')\n\n== External encoding\n\nEach IO object has an external encoding which indicates the encoding that\nRuby will use to read its data. By default Ruby sets the external encoding\nof an IO object to the default external encoding. The default external\nencoding is set by locale encoding or the interpreter <code>-E</code> option.\nEncoding.default_external returns the current value of the external\nencoding.\n\n  ENV[\"LANG\"]\n  #=> \"UTF-8\"\n  Encoding.default_external\n  #=> #<Encoding:UTF-8>\n\n  $ ruby -E ISO-8859-1 -e \"p Encoding.default_external\"\n  #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>\n\n  $ LANG=C ruby -e 'p Encoding.default_external'\n  #<Encoding:US-ASCII>\n\nThe default external encoding may also be set through\nEncoding.default_external=, but you should not do this as strings created\nbefore and after the change will have inconsistent encodings.  Instead use\n<code>ruby -E</code> to invoke ruby with the correct external encoding.\n\nWhen you know that the actual encoding of the data of an IO object is not\nthe default external encoding, you can reset its external encoding with\nIO#set_encoding or set it at IO object creation (see IO.new options).\n\n== Internal encoding\n\nTo process the data of an IO object which has an encoding different\nfrom its external encoding, you can set its internal encoding. Ruby will use\nthis internal encoding to transcode the data when it is read from the IO\nobject.\n\nConversely, when data is written to the IO object it is transcoded from the\ninternal encoding to the external encoding of the IO object.\n\nThe internal encoding of an IO object can be set with\nIO#set_encoding or at IO object creation (see IO.new options).\n\nThe internal encoding is optional and when not set, the Ruby default\ninternal encoding is used. If not explicitly set this default internal\nencoding is +nil+ meaning that by default, no transcoding occurs.\n\nThe default internal encoding can be set with the interpreter option\n<code>-E</code>. Encoding.default_internal returns the current internal\nencoding.\n\n   $ ruby -e 'p Encoding.default_internal'\n   nil\n\n   $ ruby -E ISO-8859-1:UTF-8 -e \"p [Encoding.default_external, \\\n     Encoding.default_internal]\"\n   [#<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>, #<Encoding:UTF-8>]\n\nThe default internal encoding may also be set through\nEncoding.default_internal=, but you should not do this as strings created\nbefore and after the change will have inconsistent encodings.

See IO.new for these options.  See\nKernel#open for details of the various command formats described above.\n\nIO.popen, the Open3 library, or  Process#spawn may also be used to\ncommunicate with subprocesses through an IO.\n\nRuby will convert pathnames between different operating system\nconventions if possible.  For instance, on a Windows system the\nfilename <code>\"/gumby/ruby/test.rb\"</code> will be opened as\n<code>\"\\gumby\\ruby\\test.rb\"</code>.  When specifying a Windows-style\nfilename in a Ruby string, remember to escape the backslashes:\n\n  \"C:\\\\gumby\\\\ruby\\\\test.rb\"\n\nOur examples here will use the Unix-style forward slashes;\nFile::ALT_SEPARATOR can be used to get the platform-specific separator\ncharacter.\n\nThe global constant ARGF (also accessible as <code>$<</code>) provides an\nIO-like stream which allows access to all files mentioned on the\ncommand line (or STDIN if no files are mentioned).

And\n\t     sets external encoding to ASCII-8BIT unless explicitly\n\t     specified.\n\n\t\"t\"  Text file mode\n\nThe exclusive access mode (\"x\") can be used together with \"w\" to ensure\nthe file is created. Errno::EEXIST is raised when it already exists.\nIt may not be supported with all kinds of streams (e.g. pipes).\n\nWhen the open mode of original IO is read only, the mode cannot be\nchanged to be writable.  Similarly, the open mode cannot be changed from\nwrite only to readable.\n\nWhen such a change is attempted the error is raised in different locations\naccording to the platform.\n\n=== IO Encoding\n\nWhen +ext_enc+ is specified, strings read will be tagged by the encoding\nwhen reading, and strings output will be converted to the specified\nencoding when writing.\n\nWhen +ext_enc+ and +int_enc+ are specified read strings will be converted\nfrom +ext_enc+ to +int_enc+ upon input, and written strings will be\nconverted from +int_enc+ to +ext_enc+ upon output.  See Encoding for\nfurther details of transcoding on input and output.\n\nIf \"BOM|UTF-8\", \"BOM|UTF-16LE\" or \"BOM|UTF16-BE\" are used, Ruby checks for\na Unicode BOM in the input document to help determine the encoding.  For\nUTF-16 encodings the file open mode must be binary.  When present, the BOM\nis stripped and the external encoding from the BOM is used.  When the BOM\nis missing the given Unicode encoding is used as +ext_enc+.  (The BOM-set\nencoding option is case insensitive, so \"bom|utf-8\" is also valid.)\n\n=== Options\n\n+opt+ can be used instead of +mode+ for improved readability.  The\nfollowing keys are supported:\n\n:mode ::\n  Same as +mode+ parameter\n\n:flags ::\n  Specifies file open flags as integer.\n  If +mode+ parameter is given, this parameter will be bitwise-ORed.\n\n:\\external_encoding ::\n  External encoding for the IO.\n\n:\\internal_encoding ::\n  Internal encoding for the IO.  \"-\" is a synonym for the default internal\n  encoding.\n\n  If the value is +nil+ no conversion occurs.\n\n:encoding ::\n  Specifies external and internal encodings as \"extern:intern\".\n\n:textmode ::\n  If the value is truth value, same as \"t\" in argument +mode+.\n\n:binmode ::\n  If the value is truth value, same as \"b\" in argument +mode+.\n\n:autoclose ::\n  If the value is +false+, the +fd+ will be kept open after this IO\n  instance gets finalized.\n\nAlso, +opt+ can have same keys in String#encode for controlling conversion\nbetween the external encoding and the internal encoding.\n\n=== Example 1\n\n  fd = IO.sysopen(\"/dev/tty\", \"w\")\n  a = IO.new(fd,\"w\")\n  $stderr.puts \"Hello\"\n  a.puts \"World\"\n\nProduces:\n\n  Hello\n  World\n\n=== Example 2\n\n  require 'fcntl'\n\n  fd = STDERR.fcntl(Fcntl::F_DUPFD)\n  io = IO.new(fd, mode: 'w:UTF-16LE', cr_newline: true)\n  io.puts \"Hello, World!\"\n\n  fd = STDERR.fcntl(Fcntl::F_DUPFD)\n  io = IO.new(fd, mode: 'w', cr_newline: true,\n              external_encoding: Encoding::UTF_16LE)\n  io.puts \"Hello, World!\"\n\nBoth of above print \"Hello, World!\" in UTF-16LE to standard error output\nwith converting EOL generated by #puts to CR.","name":"initialize","namespace":"IO","path":"IO#initialize","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"IO#initialize_copy":{"description":":nodoc:","name":"initialize_copy","namespace":"IO","path":"IO#initialize_copy","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"IO#inspect":{"description":"Return a string describing this IO object.","name":"inspect","namespace":"IO","path":"IO#inspect","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"IO#internal_encoding":{"description":"Returns the Encoding of the internal string if conversion is\nspecified.

This \"peek\" only happens for IO objects.  It does not\nhappen for IO-like objects such as OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.\n\nThe best way to use IO.select is invoking it after nonblocking\nmethods such as #read_nonblock, #write_nonblock, etc.  The methods\nraise an exception which is extended by IO::WaitReadable or\nIO::WaitWritable.  The modules notify how the caller should wait\nwith IO.select.  If IO::WaitReadable is raised, the caller should\nwait for reading.  If IO::WaitWritable is raised, the caller should\nwait for writing.\n\nSo, blocking read (#readpartial) can be emulated using\n#read_nonblock and IO.select as follows:\n\n  begin\n    result = io_like.read_nonblock(maxlen)\n  rescue IO::WaitReadable\n    IO.select([io_like])\n    retry\n  rescue IO::WaitWritable\n    IO.select(nil, [io_like])\n    retry\n  end\n\nEspecially, the combination of nonblocking methods and IO.select is\npreferred for IO like objects such as OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.  It\nhas #to_io method to return underlying IO object.  IO.select calls\n#to_io to obtain the file descriptor to wait.\n\nThis means that readability notified by IO.select doesn't mean\nreadability from OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket object.\n\nThe most likely situation is that OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket buffers\nsome data.  IO.select doesn't see the buffer.  So IO.select can\nblock when OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial doesn't block.\n\nHowever, several more complicated situations exist.\n\nSSL is a protocol which is sequence of records.\nThe record consists of multiple bytes.\nSo, the remote side of SSL sends a partial record, IO.select\nnotifies readability but OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket cannot decrypt a\nbyte and OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial will block.\n\nAlso, the remote side can request SSL renegotiation which forces\nthe local SSL engine to write some data.\nThis means OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#readpartial may invoke #write\nsystem call and it can block.\nIn such a situation, OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#read_nonblock raises\nIO::WaitWritable instead of blocking.\nSo, the caller should wait for ready for writability as above\nexample.\n\nThe combination of nonblocking methods and IO.select is also useful\nfor streams such as tty, pipe socket socket when multiple processes\nread from a stream.\n\nFinally, Linux kernel developers don't guarantee that\nreadability of select(2) means readability of following read(2) even\nfor a single process.\nSee select(2) manual on GNU/Linux system.\n\nInvoking IO.select before IO#readpartial works well as usual.\nHowever it is not the best way to use IO.select.\n\nThe writability notified by select(2) doesn't show\nhow many bytes are writable.\nIO#write method blocks until given whole string is written.\nSo, <code>IO#write(two or more bytes)</code> can block after\nwritability is notified by IO.select.  IO#write_nonblock is required\nto avoid the blocking.\n\nBlocking write (#write) can be emulated using #write_nonblock and\nIO.select as follows: IO::WaitReadable should also be rescued for\nSSL renegotiation in OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.\n\n  while 0 < string.bytesize\n    begin\n      written = io_like.write_nonblock(string)\n    rescue IO::WaitReadable\n      IO.select([io_like])\n      retry\n    rescue IO::WaitWritable\n      IO.select(nil, [io_like])\n      retry\n    end\n    string = string.byteslice(written..-1)\n  end\n\n=== Parameters\nread_array:: an array of IO objects that wait until ready for read\nwrite_array:: an array of IO objects that wait until ready for write\nerror_array:: an array of IO objects that wait for exceptions\ntimeout:: a numeric value in second\n\n=== Example\n\n    rp, wp = IO.pipe\n    mesg = \"ping \"\n    100.times {\n      # IO.select follows IO#read.

collection of unique keys and their values.\nAlso called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an\nArray uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object\ntype.\n\nHashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys\nwere inserted.\n\nA Hash can be easily created by using its implicit form:\n\n  grades = { \"Jane Doe\" => 10, \"Jim Doe\" => 6 }\n\nHashes allow an alternate syntax for keys that are symbols.\nInstead of\n\n  options = { :font_size => 10, :font_family => \"Arial\" }\n\nYou could write it as:\n\n  options = { font_size: 10, font_family: \"Arial\" }\n\nEach named key is a symbol you can access in hash:\n\n  options[:font_size]  # => 10\n\nA Hash can also be created through its ::new method:\n\n  grades = Hash.new\n  grades[\"Dorothy Doe\"] = 9\n\nHashes have a <em>default value</em> that is returned when accessing\nkeys that do not exist in the hash. If no default is set +nil+ is used.\nYou can set the default value by sending it as an argument to Hash.new:\n\n  grades = Hash.new(0)\n\nOr by using the #default= method:\n\n  grades = {\"Timmy Doe\" => 8}\n  grades.default = 0\n\nAccessing a value in a Hash requires using its key:\n\n  puts grades[\"Jane Doe\"] # => 0\n\n=== Common Uses\n\nHashes are an easy way to represent data structures, such as\n\n  books         = {}\n  books[:matz]  = \"The Ruby Programming Language\"\n  books[:black] = \"The Well-Grounded Rubyist\"\n\nHashes are also commonly used as a way to have named parameters in\nfunctions. Note that no brackets are used below. If a hash is the last\nargument on a method call, no braces are needed, thus creating a really\nclean interface:\n\n  Person.create(name: \"John Doe\", age: 27)\n\n  def self.create(params)\n    @name = params[:name]\n    @age  = params[:age]\n  end\n\n=== Hash Keys\n\nTwo objects refer to the same hash key when their <code>hash</code> value\nis identical and the two objects are <code>eql?</code> to each other.\n\nA user-defined class may be used as a hash key if the <code>hash</code>\nand <code>eql?</code> methods are overridden to provide meaningful\nbehavior.  By default, separate instances refer to separate hash keys.\n\nA typical implementation of <code>hash</code> is based on the\nobject's data while <code>eql?</code> is usually aliased to the overridden\n<code>==</code> method:\n\n  class Book\n    attr_reader :author, :title\n\n    def initialize(author, title)\n      @author = author\n      @title = title\n    end\n\n    def ==(other)\n      self.class === other and\n        other.author == @author and\n        other.title == @title\n    end\n\n    alias eql? ==\n\n    def hash\n      @author.hash ^ @title.hash # XOR\n    end\n  end\n\n  book1 = Book.new 'matz', 'Ruby in a Nutshell'\n  book2 = Book.new 'matz', 'Ruby in a Nutshell'\n\n  reviews = {}\n\n  reviews[book1] = 'Great reference!'\n  reviews[book2] = 'Nice and compact!'\n\n  reviews.length #=> 1\n\nSee also Object#hash and Object#eql?","name":"Hash","namespace":"","path":"Hash","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"Hash#<":{"description":"Returns <code>true</code> if <i>hash</i> is subset of\n<i>other</i>.\n\n   h1 = {a:1, b:2}\n   h2 = {a:1, b:2, c:3}\n   h1 < h2    #=> true\n   h2 < h1    #=> false\n   h1 < h1    #=> false","name":"<","namespace":"Hash","path":"Hash#<","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Hash#<=":{"description":"Returns <code>true</code> if <i>hash</i> is subset of\n<i>other</i> or equals to <i>other</i>.\n\n   h1 = {a:1, b:2}\n   h2 = {a:1, b:2, c:3}\n   h1 <= h2   #=> true\n   h2 <= h1   #=> false\n   h1 <= h1   #=> true","name":"<=","namespace":"Hash","path":"Hash#<=","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Hash#==":{"description":"Equality---Two hashes are equal if they each contain the same number\nof keys and if each key-value pair is equal to (according to\nObject#==) the corresponding elements in the other hash.\n\n   h1 = { \"a\" => 1, \"c\" => 2 }\n   h2 = { 7 => 35, \"c\" => 2, \"a\" => 1 }\n   h3 = { \"a\" => 1, \"c\" => 2, 7 => 35 }\n   h4 = { \"a\" => 1, \"d\" => 2, \"f\" => 35 }\n   h1 == h2   #=> false\n   h2 == h3   #=> true\n   h3 == h4   #=> false\n\nThe orders of each hashes are not compared.\n\n   h1 = { \"a\" => 1, \"c\" => 2 }\n   h2 = { \"c\" => 2, \"a\" => 1 }\n   h1 == h2   #=> true","name":"==","namespace":"Hash","path":"Hash#==","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Hash#>":{"description":"Returns <code>true</code> if <i>other</i> is subset of\n<i>hash</i>.\n\n   h1 = {a:1, b:2}\n   h2 = {a:1, b:2, c:3}\n   h1 > h2    #=> false\n   h2 > h1    #=> true\n   h1 > h1    #=> false","name":">","namespace":"Hash","path":"Hash#>","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Hash#>=":{"description":"Returns <code>true</code> if <i>other</i> is subset of\n<i>hash</i> or equals to <i>hash</i>.\n\n   h1 = {a:1, b:2}\n   h2 = {a:1, b:2, c:3}\n   h1 >= h2   #=> false\n   h2 >= h1   #=> true\n   h1 >= h1   #=> true","name":">=","namespace":"Hash","path":"Hash#>=","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Hash#[]":{"description":"Element Reference---Retrieves the <i>value</i> object corresponding\nto the <i>key</i> object.

+return+ in non-lambda proc, +b+, exits +m2+.\n    # (The block +{ return }+ is given for +m1+ and embraced by +m2+.)\n    $a = []; def m1(&b) b.call; $a << :m1 end; def m2() m1 { return }; $a << :m2 end; m2; p $a\n    #=> []\n\n    # +break+ in non-lambda proc, +b+, exits +m1+.\n    # (The block +{ break }+ is given for +m1+ and embraced by +m2+.)\n    $a = []; def m1(&b) b.call; $a << :m1 end; def m2() m1 { break }; $a << :m2 end; m2; p $a\n    #=> [:m2]\n\n    #

Using +proc+ method changes the behavior as follows because\n    # The block is given for +proc+ method and embraced by +m2+.\n    $a = []; def m1(&b) b.call; $a << :m1 end; def m2() m1(&proc { return }); $a << :m2 end; m2; p $a\n    #=> []\n    $a = []; def m1(&b) b.call; $a << :m1 end; def m2() m1(&proc { break }); $a << :m2 end; m2; p $a\n    #

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    end\n\nInside +map+, the block of code is treated as a regular (non-lambda) proc,\nwhich means that the internal arrays will be deconstructed to pairs of\narguments, and +return+ will exit from the method +test+. That would\nnot be possible with a stricter lambda.\n\nYou can tell a lambda from a regular proc by using the #lambda? instance method.\n\nLambda semantics is typically preserved during the proc lifetime, including\n<code>&</code>-deconstruction to a block of code:\n\n    p = proc {|x, y| x }\n    l = lambda {|x, y| x }\n    [[1, 2], [3, 4]].map(&p) #=> [1, 2]\n    [[1, 2], [3, 4]].map(&l) # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)\n\nThe only exception is dynamic method definition: even if defined by\npassing a non-lambda proc, methods still have normal semantics of argument\nchecking.\n\n class C\n   define_method(:e, &proc {})\n end\n C.new.e(1,2)       #=> ArgumentError\n C.new.method(:e).to_proc.lambda?   #=> true\n\nThis exception ensures that methods never have unusual argument passing\nconventions, and makes it easy to have wrappers defining methods that\nbehave as usual.\n\n class C\n   def self.def2(name, &body)\n     define_method(name, &body)\n   end\n\n   def2(:f) {}\n end\n C.new.f(1,2)       #=> ArgumentError\n\nThe wrapper <code>def2</code> receives _body_ as a non-lambda proc,\nyet defines a method which has normal semantics.\n\n== Conversion of other objects to procs\n\nAny object that implements the +to_proc+ method can be converted into\na proc by the <code>&</code> operator, and therefore con be\nconsumed by iterators.\n\n\n    class Greeter\n      def initialize(greeting)\n        @greeting = greeting\n      end\n\n      def to_proc\n        proc {|name| \"#{@greeting}, #{name}!\" }\n      end\n    end\n\n    hi = Greeter.new(\"Hi\")\n    hey = Greeter.new(\"Hey\")\n    [\"Bob\", \"Jane\"].map(&hi)    #=> [\"Hi, Bob!\", \"Hi, Jane!\"]\n    [\"Bob\", \"Jane\"].map(&hey)   #=> [\"Hey, Bob!\", \"Hey, Jane!\"]\n\nOf the Ruby core classes, this method is implemented by Symbol,\nMethod, and Hash.\n\n    :to_s.to_proc.call(1)           #=> \"1\"\n    [1, 2].map(&:to_s)              #=> [\"1\", \"2\"]\n\n    method(:puts).to_proc.call(1)   # prints 1\n    [1, 2].each(&method(:puts))     # prints 1, 2\n\n    {test: 1}.to_proc.call(:test)       #=> 1\n    %i[test many keys].map(&{test: 1})  #=> [1, nil, nil]\n\n== Orphaned Proc\n\n+return+ and +break+ in a block exit a method.\nIf a Proc object is generated from the block and the Proc object\nsurvives until the method is returned, +return+ and +break+ cannot work.\nIn such case, +return+ and +break+ raises LocalJumpError.\nA Proc object in such situation is called as orphaned Proc object.\n\nNote that the method to exit is different for +return+ and +break+.\nThere is a situation that orphaned for +break+ but not orphaned for +return+.\n\n   def m1(&b) b.call end; def m2(); m1 { return } end; m2 # ok\n   def m1(&b) b.call end; def m2(); m1 { break } end; m2 # ok\n\n   def m1(&b) b end; def m2(); m1 { return }.call end; m2 # ok\n   def m1(&b) b end; def m2(); m1 { break }.call end;

(SUSv4 obsoleted it, though.)\n  The resolution is 1 microsecond.\n[:TIME_BASED_CLOCK_REALTIME]\n  Use time() defined by ISO C.\n  The resolution is 1 second.\n\nEmulations for +CLOCK_MONOTONIC+:\n[:MACH_ABSOLUTE_TIME_BASED_CLOCK_MONOTONIC]\n  Use mach_absolute_time(), available on Darwin.\n  The resolution is CPU dependent.\n[:TIMES_BASED_CLOCK_MONOTONIC]\n  Use the result value of times() defined by POSIX.\n  POSIX defines it as \"times() shall return the elapsed real time, in clock ticks, since an arbitrary point in the past (for example, system start-up time)\".\n  For example, GNU/Linux returns a value based on jiffies and it is monotonic.\n  However, 4.4BSD uses gettimeofday() and it is not monotonic.\n  (FreeBSD uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) instead, though.)\n  The resolution is the clock tick.\n  \"getconf CLK_TCK\" command shows the clock ticks per second.\n  (The clock ticks per second is defined by HZ macro in older systems.)\n  If it is 100 and clock_t is 32 bits integer type, the resolution is 10 millisecond and\n  cannot represent over 497 days.\n\nEmulations for +CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID+:\n[:GETRUSAGE_BASED_CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID]\n  Use getrusage() defined by SUS.\n  getrusage() is used with RUSAGE_SELF to obtain the time only for\n  the calling process (excluding the time for child processes).\n  The result is addition of user time (ru_utime) and system time (ru_stime).\n  The resolution is 1 microsecond.\n[:TIMES_BASED_CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID]\n  Use times() defined by POSIX.\n  The result is addition of user time (tms_utime) and system time (tms_stime).\n  tms_cutime and tms_cstime are ignored to exclude the time for child processes.\n  The resolution is the clock tick.\n  \"getconf CLK_TCK\" command shows the clock ticks per second.\n  (The clock ticks per second is defined by HZ macro in older systems.)\n  If it is 100, the resolution is 10 millisecond.\n[:CLOCK_BASED_CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID]\n  Use clock() defined by ISO C.\n  The resolution is 1/CLOCKS_PER_SEC.\n  CLOCKS_PER_SEC is the C-level macro defined by time.h.\n  SUS defines CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1000000.\n  Non-Unix systems may define it a different value, though.\n  If CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1000000 as SUS, the resolution is 1 microsecond.\n  If CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1000000 and clock_t is 32 bits integer type, it cannot represent over 72 minutes.\n\nIf the given +clock_id+ is not supported, Errno::EINVAL is raised.\n\n+unit+ specifies a type of the return value.\n\n[:float_second] number of seconds as a float (default)\n[:float_millisecond] number of milliseconds as a float\n[:float_microsecond] number of microseconds as a float\n[:second] number of seconds as an integer\n[:millisecond] number of milliseconds as an integer\n[:microsecond] number of microseconds as an integer\n[:nanosecond] number of nanoseconds as an integer\n\nThe underlying function, clock_gettime(), returns a number of nanoseconds.\nFloat object (IEEE 754 double) is not enough to represent\nthe return value for CLOCK_REALTIME.\nIf the exact nanoseconds value is required, use +:nanoseconds+ as the +unit+.\n\nThe origin (zero) of the returned value varies.\nFor example, system start up time, process start up time, the Epoch, etc.\n\nThe origin in CLOCK_REALTIME is defined as the Epoch\n(1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).\nBut some systems count leap seconds and others doesn't.\nSo the result can be interpreted differently across systems.\nTime.now is

Unix Specification.\nSUS contains POSIX and clock_gettime is defined in the POSIX part.\nSUS defines CLOCK_REALTIME mandatory but\nCLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID are optional.\n\nAlso, several symbols are accepted as +clock_id+.\nThere are emulations for clock_gettime().\n\nFor example, Process::CLOCK_REALTIME is defined as\n+:GETTIMEOFDAY_BASED_CLOCK_REALTIME+ when clock_gettime() is not available.\n\nEmulations for +CLOCK_REALTIME+:\n[:GETTIMEOFDAY_BASED_CLOCK_REALTIME]\n  Use gettimeofday() defined by SUS.\n  (SUSv4 obsoleted it, though.)\n  The resolution is 1 microsecond.\n[:TIME_BASED_CLOCK_REALTIME]\n  Use time() defined by ISO C.\n  The resolution is 1 second.\n\nEmulations for +CLOCK_MONOTONIC+:\n[:MACH_ABSOLUTE_TIME_BASED_CLOCK_MONOTONIC]\n  Use mach_absolute_time(), available on Darwin.\n  The resolution is CPU dependent.\n[:TIMES_BASED_CLOCK_MONOTONIC]\n  Use the result value of times() defined by POSIX.\n  POSIX defines it as \"times() shall return the elapsed real time, in clock ticks, since an arbitrary point in the past (for example, system start-up time)\".\n  For example, GNU/Linux returns a value based on jiffies and it is monotonic.\n  However, 4.4BSD uses gettimeofday() and it is not monotonic.\n  (FreeBSD uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) instead, though.)\n  The resolution is the clock tick.\n  \"getconf CLK_TCK\" command shows the clock ticks per second.\n  (The clock ticks per second is defined by HZ macro in older systems.)\n  If it is 100 and clock_t is 32 bits integer type, the resolution is 10 millisecond and\n  cannot represent over 497 days.\n\nEmulations for +CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID+:\n[:GETRUSAGE_BASED_CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID]\n  Use getrusage() defined by SUS.\n  getrusage() is used with RUSAGE_SELF to obtain the time only for\n  the calling process (excluding the time for child processes).\n  The result is addition of user time (ru_utime) and system time (ru_stime).\n  The resolution is 1 microsecond.\n[:TIMES_BASED_CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID]\n  Use times() defined by POSIX.\n  The result is addition of user time (tms_utime) and system time (tms_stime).\n  tms_cutime and tms_cstime are ignored to exclude the time for child processes.\n  The resolution is the clock tick.\n  \"getconf CLK_TCK\" command shows the clock ticks per second.\n  (The clock ticks per second is defined by HZ macro in older systems.)\n  If it is 100, the resolution is 10 millisecond.\n[:CLOCK_BASED_CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID]\n  Use clock() defined by ISO C.\n  The resolution is 1/CLOCKS_PER_SEC.\n  CLOCKS_PER_SEC is the C-level macro defined by time.h.\n  SUS defines CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1000000.\n  Non-Unix systems may define it a different value, though.\n  If CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1000000 as SUS, the resolution is 1 microsecond.\n  If CLOCKS_PER_SEC is 1000000 and clock_t is 32 bits integer type, it cannot represent over 72 minutes.\n\nIf the given +clock_id+ is not supported, Errno::EINVAL is raised.\n\n+unit+ specifies a type of the return value.\n\n[:float_second] number of seconds as a float (default)\n[:float_millisecond] number of milliseconds as a float\n[:float_microsecond] number of microseconds as a float\n[:second] number of seconds as an integer\n[:millisecond] number of milliseconds as an integer\n[:microsecond] number of microseconds as an integer\n[:nanosecond] number of nanoseconds as an integer\n\nThe underlying function, clock_gettime(), returns a number of nanoseconds.\nFloat object (IEEE 754 double) is not enough to represent\nthe return value for CLOCK_REALTIME.\nIf the exact nanoseconds value is required, use +:nanoseconds+ as the +unit+.\n\nThe origin (zero) of the returned value varies.\nFor example, system start up time, process start up time, the Epoch, etc.\n\nThe origin in CLOCK_REALTIME is defined as the Epoch\n(1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).\nBut some systems count leap seconds and others doesn't.\nSo the result can be interpreted differently across systems.\nTime.now is

An example of this is +'echo'+, which is a\nbuilt-in on Windows, but is a normal program on Linux and Mac OS X.\nThis means that <code>Process.spawn 'echo', '%Path%'</code> will\ndisplay the contents of the <tt>%Path%</tt> environment variable\non Windows, but <code>Process.spawn 'echo', '$PATH'</code> prints\nthe literal <tt>$PATH</tt>.\n\nIf a hash is given as +env+, the environment is\nupdated by +env+ before <code>exec(2)</code> in the child process.\nIf a pair in +env+ has nil as the value, the variable is deleted.\n\n  # set FOO as BAR and unset BAZ.\n  pid = spawn({\"FOO\"=>\"BAR\", \"BAZ\"=>nil}, command)\n\nIf a hash is given as +options+,\nit specifies\nprocess group,\ncreate new process group,\nresource limit,\ncurrent directory,\numask and\nredirects for the child process.\nAlso, it can be specified to clear environment variables.\n\nThe <code>:unsetenv_others</code> key in +options+ specifies\nto clear environment variables, other than specified by +env+.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :unsetenv_others=>true) # no environment variable\n  pid = spawn({\"FOO\"=>\"BAR\"}, command, :unsetenv_others=>true) # FOO only\n\nThe <code>:pgroup</code> key in +options+ specifies a process group.\nThe corresponding value should be true, zero, a positive integer, or nil.\ntrue and zero cause the process to be a process leader of a new process group.\nA non-zero positive integer causes the process to join the provided process group.\nThe default value, nil, causes the process to remain in the same process group.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :pgroup=>true) # process leader\n  pid = spawn(command, :pgroup=>10) # belongs to the process group 10\n\nThe <code>:new_pgroup</code> key in +options+ specifies to pass\n+CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP+ flag to <code>CreateProcessW()</code> that is\nWindows API. This option is only for Windows.\ntrue means the new process is the root process of the new process group.\nThe new process has CTRL+C disabled. This flag is necessary for\n<code>Process.kill(:SIGINT, pid)</code> on the subprocess.\n:new_pgroup is false by default.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :new_pgroup=>true)  # new process group\n  pid = spawn(command, :new_pgroup=>false) # same process group\n\nThe <code>:rlimit_</code><em>foo</em> key specifies a resource limit.\n<em>foo</em> should be one of resource types such as <code>core</code>.\nThe corresponding value should be an integer or an array which have one or\ntwo integers: same as cur_limit and max_limit arguments for\nProcess.setrlimit.\n\n  cur, max = Process.getrlimit(:CORE)\n  pid = spawn(command, :rlimit_core=>[0,max]) # disable core temporary.\n  pid = spawn(command, :rlimit_core=>max) # enable core dump\n  pid = spawn(command, :rlimit_core=>0) # never dump core.\n\nThe <code>:umask</code> key in +options+ specifies the umask.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :umask=>077)\n\nThe :in, :out, :err, an integer, an IO and an array key specifies a redirection.\nThe redirection maps a file descriptor in the child process.\n\nFor example, stderr can be merged into stdout as follows:\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :err=>:out)\n  pid = spawn(command, 2=>1)\n  pid = spawn(command, STDERR=>:out)\n  pid = spawn(command, STDERR=>STDOUT)\n\nThe hash keys specifies a file descriptor in the child process\nstarted by #spawn.\n:err, 2 and STDERR specifies the standard error stream (stderr).\n\nThe hash values specifies a file descriptor in the parent process\nwhich invokes #spawn.\n:out, 1 and STDOUT specifies the standard output stream (stdout).\n\nIn the above example,\nthe standard output in the child process is not specified.\nSo it is inherited from the parent process.\n\nThe standard input stream (stdin) can be specified by :in, 0 and STDIN.\n\nA filename can be specified as a hash value.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :in=>\"/dev/null\") # read mode\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>\"/dev/null\") # write mode\n  pid = spawn(command, :err=>\"log\") # write mode\n  pid = spawn(command, [:out, :err]=>\"/dev/null\") # write mode\n  pid = spawn(command, 3=>\"/dev/null\") # read mode\n\nFor stdout and stderr (and combination of them),\nit is opened in write mode.\nOtherwise read mode is used.\n\nFor specifying flags and permission of file creation explicitly,\nan array is used instead.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :in=>[\"file\"]) # read mode is assumed\n  pid = spawn(command, :in=>[\"file\", \"r\"])\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", \"w\"]) # 0644 assumed\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", \"w\", 0600])\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", File::WRONLY|File::EXCL|File::CREAT, 0600])\n\nThe array specifies a filename, flags and permission.\nThe flags can be a string or an integer.\nIf the flags is omitted or nil, File::RDONLY is assumed.\nThe permission should be an integer.\nIf the permission is omitted or nil, 0644 is assumed.\n\nIf an array of IOs and integers are specified as a hash key,\nall the elements are redirected.\n\n  # stdout and stderr is redirected to log file.\n  # The file \"log\" is opened just once.\n  pid = spawn(command, [:out, :err]=>[\"log\", \"w\"])\n\nAnother way to merge multiple file descriptors is [:child, fd].\n\\[:child, fd] means the file descriptor in the child process.\nThis is different from fd.\nFor example, :err=>:out means redirecting child stderr to parent stdout.\nBut :err=>[:child, :out] means redirecting child stderr to child stdout.\nThey differ if stdout is redirected in the child process as follows.\n\n  # stdout and stderr is redirected to log file.\n  # The file \"log\" is opened just once.\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>[\"log\", \"w\"], :err=>[:child, :out])\n\n\\[:child, :out] can be used to merge stderr into stdout in IO.popen.\nIn this case, IO.popen redirects stdout to a pipe in the child process\nand [:child, :out] refers the redirected stdout.\n\n  io = IO.popen([\"sh\", \"-c\", \"echo out; echo err >&2\", :err=>[:child, :out]])\n  p io.read #=> \"out\\nerr\\n\"\n\nThe <code>:chdir</code> key in +options+ specifies the current directory.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :chdir=>\"/var/tmp\")\n\nspawn closes all non-standard unspecified descriptors by default.\nThe \"standard\" descriptors are 0, 1 and 2.\nThis behavior is specified by :close_others option.\n:close_others doesn't affect the standard descriptors which are\nclosed only if :close is specified explicitly.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :close_others=>true)  # close 3,4,5,... (default)\n  pid = spawn(command, :close_others=>false) # don't close 3,4,5,...\n\n:close_others is false by default for spawn and IO.popen.\n\nNote that fds which close-on-exec flag is already set are closed\nregardless of :close_others option.\n\nSo IO.pipe and spawn can be used as IO.popen.\n\n  # similar to r = IO.popen(command)\n  r, w = IO.pipe\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>w)   # r, w is closed in the child process.\n  w.close\n\n:close is specified as a hash value to close a fd individually.\n\n  f = open(foo)\n  system(command, f=>:close)        # don't inherit f.\n\nIf a file descriptor need to be inherited,\nio=>io can be used.\n\n  # valgrind has --log-fd option for log destination.\n  # log_w=>log_w indicates log_w.fileno inherits to child process.\n  log_r, log_w = IO.pipe\n  pid = spawn(\"valgrind\", \"--log-fd=#{log_w.fileno}\", \"echo\", \"a\", log_w=>log_w)\n  log_w.close\n  p log_r.read\n\nIt is also possible to exchange file descriptors.\n\n  pid = spawn(command, :out=>:err, :err=>:out)\n\nThe hash keys specify file descriptors in the child process.\nThe hash values specifies file descriptors in the parent process.\nSo the above specifies exchanging stdout and stderr.\nInternally, +spawn+ uses an extra file descriptor to resolve such cyclic\nfile descriptor mapping.\n\nSee Kernel.exec for the standard shell.","name":"spawn","namespace":"Process","path":"Process.spawn","type":"module_function","visibility":"public"},"Process.times":{"description":"Returns a <code>Tms</code> structure (see Process::Tms)\nthat contains user and system CPU times for this process,\nand also for children processes.\n\n   t = Process.times\n   [ t.utime, t.stime, t.cutime, t.cstime ]   #=> [0.0, 0.02, 0.00, 0.00]","name":"times","namespace":"Process","path":"Process.times","type":"module_function","visibility":"public"},"Process.uid":{"description":"Returns the (real) user ID of this process.\n\n   Process.uid   #=> 501","name":"uid","namespace":"Process","path":"Process.uid","type":"module_function","visibility":"public"},"Process.uid=":{"description":"Sets the (user) user ID for this process.

To illustrate:\n\n    Thread.new {\n      Thread.current[:foo] = \"bar\"\n      Fiber.new {\n        p Thread.current[:foo] # => nil\n      }.resume\n    }.join\n\n\tThis example uses #[] for getting and #[]= for setting fiber-locals,\n\tyou can also use #keys to list the fiber-locals for a given\n\tthread and #key? to check if a fiber-local exists.\n\nWhen it comes to thread-locals, they are accessible within the entire\nscope of the thread. Given the following example:\n\n    Thread.new{\n      Thread.current.thread_variable_set(:foo, 1)\n      p Thread.current.thread_variable_get(:foo) # => 1\n      Fiber.new{\n\tThread.current.thread_variable_set(:foo, 2)\n\tp Thread.current.thread_variable_get(:foo) # => 2\n      }.resume\n      p Thread.current.thread_variable_get(:foo)   # => 2\n    }.join\n\n You can see that the thread-local +:foo+ carried over into the fiber\n and was changed to +2+ by the end of the thread.\n\n This example makes use of #thread_variable_set to create new\n thread-locals, and #thread_variable_get to reference them.\n\n There is also #thread_variables to list all thread-locals, and\n #thread_variable? to check if a given thread-local exists.\n\n\t=== Exception handling\n\n When an unhandled exception is raised inside a thread, it will\n terminate. By default, this exception will not propagate to other\n threads. The exception is stored and when another thread calls #value\n or #join, the exception will be re-raised in that thread.\n\n     t = Thread.new{ raise 'something went wrong' }\n     t.value #=> RuntimeError: something went wrong\n\n An exception can be raised from outside the thread using the\n Thread#raise instance method, which takes the same parameters as\n Kernel#raise.\n\n Setting Thread.abort_on_exception = true, Thread#abort_on_exception =\n true, or $DEBUG = true will cause a subsequent unhandled exception\n raised in a thread to be automatically re-raised in the main thread.\n\nWith the addition of the class method ::handle_interrupt, you can now\nhandle exceptions asynchronously with threads.\n\n\t=== Scheduling\n\n\tRuby provides a few ways to support scheduling threads in your program.\n\n\tThe first way is by using the class method ::stop, to put the current\n\trunning thread to sleep and schedule the execution of another thread.\n\n\tOnce a thread is asleep, you can use the instance method #wakeup to\n\tmark your thread as eligible for scheduling.\n\n\tYou can also try ::pass, which attempts to pass execution to another\n\tthread but is dependent on the OS whether a running thread will switch\n\tor not. The same goes for #priority, which lets you hint to the thread\n\tscheduler which threads you want to take precedence when passing\n\texecution. This method is also dependent on the OS and may be ignored\n\ton some platforms.","name":"Thread","namespace":"","path":"Thread","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"Thread#[]":{"description":"Attribute Reference---Returns the value of a fiber-local variable (current thread's root fiber\nif not explicitly inside a Fiber), using either a symbol or a string name.\nIf the specified variable does not exist, returns +nil+.\n\n   [\n     Thread.new { Thread.current[\"name\"] = \"A\" },\n     Thread.new { Thread.current[:name]  = \"B\" },\n     Thread.new { Thread.current[\"name\"] = \"C\" }\n   ].each do |th|\n     th.join\n     puts \"#{th.inspect}: #{th[:name]}\"\n   end\n\nThis will produce:\n\n   #<Thread:0x00000002a54220 dead>: A\n   #<Thread:0x00000002a541a8 dead>: B\n   #<Thread:0x00000002a54130 dead>: C\n\nThread#[] and Thread#[]= are not thread-local but fiber-local.\nThis confusion did not exist in Ruby 1.8 because\nfibers are only available since Ruby 1.9.\nRuby 1.9 chooses that the methods behaves fiber-local to save\nfollowing idiom for dynamic scope.\n\n  def meth(newvalue)\n    begin\n      oldvalue = Thread.current[:name]\n      Thread.current[:name] = newvalue\n      yield\n    ensure\n      Thread.current[:name] = oldvalue\n    end\n  end\n\nThe idiom may not work as dynamic scope if the methods are thread-local\nand a given block switches fiber.\n\n  f = Fiber.new {\n    meth(1) {\n      Fiber.yield\n    }\n  }\n  meth(2) {\n    f.resume\n  }\n  f.resume\n  p Thread.current[:name]\n  #=> nil if fiber-local\n  #=> 2 if thread-local (The value 2 is leaked to outside of meth method.)\n\nFor thread-local variables, please see #thread_variable_get and\n#thread_variable_set.","name":"[]","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#[]","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#[]=":{"description":"Attribute Assignment---Sets or creates the value of a fiber-local variable,\nusing either a symbol or a string.\n\nSee also Thread#[].\n\nFor thread-local variables, please see #thread_variable_set and\n#thread_variable_get.","name":"[]=","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#[]=","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#abort_on_exception":{"description":"Returns the status of the thread-local ``abort on exception'' condition for\nthis +thr+.\n\nThe default is +false+.\n\nSee also #abort_on_exception=.\n\nThere is also a class level method to set this for all threads, see\n::abort_on_exception.","name":"abort_on_exception","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#abort_on_exception","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#abort_on_exception=":{"description":"When set to +true+, if this +thr+ is aborted by an exception, the\nraised exception will be re-raised in the main thread.\n\nSee also #abort_on_exception.\n\nThere is also a class level method to set this for all threads, see\n::abort_on_exception=.","name":"abort_on_exception=","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#abort_on_exception=","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#add_trace_func":{"description":"Adds _proc_ as a handler for tracing.\n\nSee Thread#set_trace_func and Kernel#set_trace_func.","name":"add_trace_func","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#add_trace_func","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#alive?":{"description":"Returns +true+ if +thr+ is running or sleeping.\n\n   thr = Thread.new { }\n   thr.join                #=> #<Thread:0x401b3fb0 dead>\n   Thread.current.alive?   #=> true\n   thr.alive?              #=> false\n\nSee also #stop? and #status.","name":"alive?","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#alive?","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#backtrace":{"description":"Returns the current backtrace of the target thread.","name":"backtrace","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#backtrace","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#backtrace_locations":{"description":"Returns the execution stack for the target thread---an array containing\nbacktrace location objects.\n\nSee Thread::Backtrace::Location for more information.\n\nThis method behaves similarly to Kernel#caller_locations except it applies\nto a specific thread.","name":"backtrace_locations","namespace":"Thread","path":"Thread#backtrace_locations","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Thread#exit":{"description":"Terminates +thr+ and schedules another thread to be run, returning\nthe terminated Thread.

Where the ExceptionClass is the interrupt handled by\nthe given block. The TimingSymbol can be one of the following symbols:\n\n[+:immediate+]   Invoke interrupts immediately.\n[+:on_blocking+] Invoke interrupts while _BlockingOperation_.\n[+:never+]       Never invoke all interrupts.\n\n_BlockingOperation_ means that the operation will block the calling thread,\nsuch as read and write.  On CRuby implementation, _BlockingOperation_ is any\noperation executed without GVL.\n\nMasked asynchronous interrupts are delayed until they are enabled.\nThis method is similar to sigprocmask(3).\n\n=== NOTE\n\nAsynchronous interrupts are difficult to use.\n\nIf you need to communicate between threads, please consider to use another way such as Queue.\n\nOr use them with deep understanding about this method.\n\n=== Usage\n\nIn this example, we can guard from Thread#raise exceptions.\n\nUsing the +:never+ TimingSymbol the RuntimeError exception will always be\nignored in the first block of the main thread. In the second\n::handle_interrupt block we can purposefully handle RuntimeError exceptions.\n\n  th = Thread.new do\n    Thread.handle_interrupt(RuntimeError => :never) {\n      begin\n        # You can write resource allocation code safely.\n        Thread.handle_interrupt(RuntimeError => :immediate) {\n     # ...\n        }\n      ensure\n        # You can write resource deallocation code safely.\n      end\n    }\n  end\n  Thread.pass\n  # ...\n  th.raise \"stop\"\n\nWhile we are ignoring the RuntimeError exception, it's safe to write our\nresource allocation code. Then, the ensure block is where we can safely\ndeallocate your resources.\n\n==== Guarding from Timeout::Error\n\nIn the next example, we will guard from the Timeout::Error exception. This\nwill help prevent from leaking resources when Timeout::Error exceptions occur\nduring normal ensure clause. For this example we use the help of the\nstandard library Timeout, from lib/timeout.rb\n\n  require 'timeout'\n  Thread.handle_interrupt(Timeout::Error => :never) {\n    timeout(10){\n      # Timeout::Error doesn't occur here\n      Thread.handle_interrupt(Timeout::Error => :on_blocking) {\n        # possible to be killed by Timeout::Error\n        # while blocking operation\n      }\n      # Timeout::Error doesn't occur here\n    }\n  }\n\nIn the first part of the +timeout+ block, we can rely on Timeout::Error being\nignored.

Time is stored internally as\nthe number of seconds with fraction since the _Epoch_, January 1, 1970\n00:00 UTC. Also see the library module Date. The Time class treats GMT\n(Greenwich Mean Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) as equivalent.\nGMT is the older way of referring to these baseline times but persists in\nthe names of calls on POSIX systems.\n\nAll times may have fraction. Be aware of this fact when comparing times\nwith each other -- times that are apparently equal when displayed may be\ndifferent when compared.\n\nSince Ruby 1.9.2, Time implementation uses a signed 63 bit integer,\nBignum or Rational.\nThe integer is a number of nanoseconds since the _Epoch_ which can\nrepresent 1823-11-12 to 2116-02-20.\nWhen Bignum or Rational is used (before 1823, after 2116, under\nnanosecond), Time works slower as when integer is used.\n\n= Examples\n\nAll of these examples were done using the EST timezone which is GMT-5.\n\n== Creating a new Time instance\n\nYou can create a new instance of Time with Time::new. This will use the\ncurrent system time. Time::now is an alias for this. You can also\npass parts of the time to Time::new such as year, month, minute, etc. When\nyou want to construct a time this way you must pass at least a year. If you\npass the year with nothing else time will default to January 1 of that year\nat 00:00:00 with the current system timezone. Here are some examples:\n\n  Time.new(2002)         #=> 2002-01-01 00:00:00 -0500\n  Time.new(2002, 10)     #=> 2002-10-01 00:00:00 -0500\n  Time.new(2002, 10, 31) #=> 2002-10-31 00:00:00 -0500\n\nYou can pass a UTC offset:\n\n  Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, \"+02:00\") #=> 2002-10-31 02:02:02 +0200\n\nOr a timezone object:\n\n  tz = timezone(\"Europe/Athens\") # Eastern European Time, UTC+2\n  Time.new(2002, 10, 31, 2, 2, 2, tz) #=> 2002-10-31 02:02:02 +0200\n\nYou can also use Time::gm, Time::local and Time::utc to infer GMT,\nlocal and UTC timezones instead of using the current system\nsetting.\n\nYou can also create a new time using Time::at which takes the number of\nseconds (or fraction of seconds) since the {Unix\nEpoch}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time].\n\n  Time.at(628232400) #=> 1989-11-28 00:00:00 -0500\n\n== Working with an instance of Time\n\nOnce you have an instance of Time there is a multitude of things you can\ndo with it. Below are some examples. For all of the following examples, we\nwill work on the assumption that you have done the following:\n\n  t = Time.new(1993, 02, 24, 12, 0, 0, \"+09:00\")\n\nWas that a monday?\n\n  t.monday? #=> false\n\nWhat year was that again?\n\n  t.year #=> 1993\n\nWas it daylight savings at the time?\n\n  t.dst? #=> false\n\nWhat's the day a year later?\n\n  t + (60*60*24*365) #=> 1994-02-24 12:00:00 +0900\n\nHow many seconds was that since the Unix Epoch?\n\n  t.to_i #=> 730522800\n\nYou can also do standard functions like compare two times.\n\n  t1 = Time.new(2010)\n  t2 = Time.new(2011)\n\n  t1 == t2 #=> false\n  t1 == t1 #=> true\n  t1 <  t2 #=> true\n  t1 >  t2 #=> false\n\n  Time.new(2010,10,31).between?(t1, t2) #=> true\n\n== Timezone argument\n\nA timezone argument must have +local_to_utc+ and +utc_to_local+\nmethods, and may have +name+, +abbr+, and +dst?+ methods.\n\nThe +local_to_utc+ method should convert a Time-like object from\nthe timezone to UTC, and +utc_to_local+ is the opposite.  The\nresult also should be a Time or Time-like object (not necessary to\nbe the same class).  The #zone of the result is just ignored.\nTime-like argument to these methods is similar to a Time object in\nUTC without sub-second; it has attribute readers for the parts,\ne.g. #year, #month, and so on, and epoch time readers, #to_i.  The\nsub-second attributes are fixed as 0, and #utc_offset, #zone,\n#isdst, and their aliases are same as a Time object in UTC.\nAlso #to_time, #+, and #- methods are defined.\n\nThe +name+ method is used for marshaling. If this method is not\ndefined on a timezone object, Time objects using that timezone\nobject can not be dumped by Marshal.\n\nThe +abbr+ method is used by '%Z' in #strftime.\n\nThe +dst?+ method is called with a +Time+ value and should return whether\nthe +Time+ value is in daylight savings time in the zone.\n\n=== Auto conversion to Timezone\n\nAt loading marshaled data, a timezone name will be converted to a timezone\nobject by +find_timezone+ class method, if the method is defined.\n\nSimilarly, that class method will be called when a timezone argument does\nnot have the necessary methods mentioned above.","name":"Time","namespace":"","path":"Time","type":"class","visibility":"public"},"Time#+":{"description":"Addition --- Adds some number of seconds (possibly fractional) to\n_time_ and returns that value as a new Time object.\n\n   t = Time.now         #=> 2007-11-19 08:22:21 -0600\n   t + (60 * 60 * 24)   #=> 2007-11-20 08:22:21 -0600","name":"+","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#+","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#-":{"description":"Difference --- Returns a difference in seconds as a Float\nbetween _time_ and +other_time+, or subtracts the given number\nof seconds in +numeric+ from _time_.\n\n   t = Time.now       #=> 2007-11-19 08:23:10 -0600\n   t2 = t + 2592000   #=> 2007-12-19 08:23:10 -0600\n   t2 - t             #=> 2592000.0\n   t2 - 2592000       #=> 2007-11-19 08:23:10 -0600","name":"-","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#-","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#<=>":{"description":"Comparison---Compares +time+ with +other_time+.\n\n-1, 0, +1 or nil depending on whether +time+ is less  than, equal to, or\ngreater than +other_time+.\n\n+nil+ is returned if the two values are incomparable.\n\n   t = Time.now       #=> 2007-11-19 08:12:12 -0600\n   t2 = t + 2592000   #=> 2007-12-19 08:12:12 -0600\n   t <=> t2           #=> -1\n   t2 <=> t           #=> 1\n\n   t = Time.now       #=> 2007-11-19 08:13:38 -0600\n   t2 = t + 0.1       #=> 2007-11-19 08:13:38 -0600\n   t.nsec             #=> 98222999\n   t2.nsec            #=> 198222999\n   t <=> t2           #=> -1\n   t2 <=> t           #=> 1\n   t <=> t            #=> 0","name":"<=>","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#<=>","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#_dump":{"description":":nodoc:","name":"_dump","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#_dump","type":"instance_method","visibility":"private"},"Time#asctime":{"description":"Returns a canonical string representation of _time_.\n\n   Time.now.asctime   #=> \"Wed Apr  9 08:56:03 2003\"\n   Time.now.ctime     #=> \"Wed Apr  9 08:56:03 2003\"","name":"asctime","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#asctime","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#ceil":{"description":"Ceils sub seconds to a given precision in decimal digits (0 digits by default).\nIt returns a new Time object.\n+ndigits+ should be zero or a positive integer.\n\n    require 'time'\n\n    t = Time.utc(2010,3,30, 5,43,25.0123456789r)\n    t.iso8601(10)          #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:25.0123456789Z\"\n    t.ceil.iso8601(10)     #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:26.0000000000Z\"\n    t.ceil(0).iso8601(10)  #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:26.0000000000Z\"\n    t.ceil(1).iso8601(10)  #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:25.1000000000Z\"\n    t.ceil(2).iso8601(10)  #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:25.0200000000Z\"\n    t.ceil(3).iso8601(10)  #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:25.0130000000Z\"\n    t.ceil(4).iso8601(10)  #=> \"2010-03-30T05:43:25.0124000000Z\"\n\n    t = Time.utc(1999,12,31, 23,59,59)\n    (t + 0.4).ceil.iso8601(3)    #=> \"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    (t + 0.9).ceil.iso8601(3)    #=> \"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    (t + 1.4).ceil.iso8601(3)    #=> \"2000-01-01T00:00:01.000Z\"\n    (t + 1.9).ceil.iso8601(3)    #=> \"2000-01-01T00:00:01.000Z\"\n\n    t = Time.utc(1999,12,31, 23,59,59)\n    (t + 0.123456789).ceil(4).iso8601(6)  #=> \"1999-12-31T23:59:59.123500Z\"","name":"ceil","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#ceil","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#ctime":{"description":"Returns a canonical string representation of _time_.\n\n   Time.now.asctime   #=> \"Wed Apr  9 08:56:03 2003\"\n   Time.now.ctime     #=> \"Wed Apr  9 08:56:03 2003\"","name":"ctime","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#ctime","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#day":{"description":"Returns the day of the month (1..n) for _time_.\n\n   t = Time.now   #=> 2007-11-19 08:27:03 -0600\n   t.day          #=> 19\n   t.mday         #=> 19","name":"day","namespace":"Time","path":"Time#day","type":"instance_method","visibility":"public"},"Time#dst?":{"description":"Returns +true+ if _time_ occurs during Daylight\nSaving Time in its time zone.\n\n # CST6CDT:\n   Time.local(2000, 1, 1).zone    #=> \"CST\"\n   Time.local(2000, 1, 1).isdst   #=> false\n   Time.local(2000, 1, 1).dst?
